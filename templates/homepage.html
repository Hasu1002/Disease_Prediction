        <h2>Overview of Common Health Conditions</h2>

        <h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops from breast cells. It can occur in both men and women, although it is much more common in women. Symptoms may include a lump in the breast, changes in breast shape or size, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. Early detection through screening, such as mammograms, can greatly improve treatment outcomes. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy.</p>

        <h3>Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin. Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow wound healing. Treatment for diabetes typically involves lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medication (such as insulin or oral medications), and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels.</p>

        <h3>Kidney Disease</h3>
        <p>Kidney disease, also known as renal disease, refers to damage to the kidneys that can lead to kidney failure if left untreated. Common causes of kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain medications. Symptoms of kidney disease may include swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, or face; changes in urine output; fatigue; shortness of breath; nausea; and itching. Treatment for kidney disease focuses on managing symptoms and addressing the underlying cause. This may include medications, lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), dialysis, or kidney transplant. Early detection and proper management are crucial for all three diseases to improve outcomes and quality of life. Regular screenings and consultations with healthcare professionals are recommended for individuals at risk or experiencing symptoms related to these conditions.</p>
